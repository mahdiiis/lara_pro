# changes 

## initial form
- move the logic in `LevelForm` to `InitialForm` 
- `LevelForm` is responsible for rendering the form for each level and handling the changes in the questions and answers, while `InitialForm` is responsible for managing the overall quiz data and handling the changes in the initial form fields (course, topic, game number, etc.) as well as the levels data.
